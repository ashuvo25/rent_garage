1. INTRODUCTION
As cities continue to grow and Dhaka areas become more congested, parking spaces are becoming increasingly difficult to find. This shortage of parking has led to frustration for drivers and inefficiency in the use of available garage spaces. Our project aims to address this growing challenge by providing a Rent Garage platform. This platform allows users to find, rent, and manage garages for parking in busy areas. Built using JavaFX, the platform is designed to make the garage renting process seamless and user-friendly. It offers a convenient way for users to browse and book garages, view available locations on an interactive map, and communicate with garage owners in real time. This project serves as a practical solution to the big parking crisis by connecting garage owners with those in need of parking, maximizing the use of otherwise idle spaces.
Purpose:
The primary purpose of the Rent Garage platform is to develop a reliable and efficient system where users can rent garages in specific dhaka locations, providing an effective solution to parking shortages. This app ensures that users can easily find and rent available garages based on their current location or desired destination, making parking less of a hassle. Simultaneously, garage owners can list their garages for rent, turning unused spaces into revenue-generating assets. The platform aims to create a streamlined experience for both renters and owners, eliminating the stress of finding parking and ensuring garages are efficiently utilized.
Objective:
Simplified Renting Process:
The platform is designed to create a streamlined and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily rent garages. The entire process, from searching for available garages to completing a booking, is simplified, ensuring that users can navigate the platform without difficulty. The focus is on providing a hassle-free experience, so users can secure parking in a matter of minutes.
Map Integration:
A key feature of the platform is the integration of a map view. This map allows users to visually explore and locate garages based on their proximity to desired locations. By using the map, users can filter garages by distance, availability, or price, making it easy to find the most convenient options. The map provides a clear and interactive way for users to see which garages are available, ensuring a smoother booking experience.
Global Chat System:
The platform includes a Global Chat System that enables real-time communication between users and garage owners. This feature allows users to ask questions about availability, negotiate pricing, or clarify garage details before confirming a booking. The ability to interact directly with garage owners enhances transparency and improves the decision-making process for users, helping them feel more confident about their rental choices.
Secure Login System:
Security is a top priority for the Rent Garage platform. The app offers a secure login feature for both users and garage owners, ensuring that all personal and payment information is protected. Each user has their own account, where they can manage bookings, view rental history, and communicate with garage owners. The login system ensures that only authorized users have access to their accounts, providing peace of mind throughout the garage rental process.


Motivation:
The rising demand for parking in dhaka city areas has motivated us to build this system. By leveraging JavaFX, we aim to offer a user-friendly experience that helps both garage owners and renters meet their needs efficiently. This project also emphasizes real-time communication, improving the interaction between renters and garage owners.

4. FUTURE WORKS
1. Integration of Payment Systems
Objective:
Currently, users can book garages, but payments may still need to be processed offline or through third-party systems. By integrating digital payment systems, the platform will allow seamless transactions within the app, which will increase user trust and convenience.
Approach:
Support for popular digital wallets (such as Google Pay, Apple Pay, and PayPal) as well as credit/debit cards.
Implementing secure, encrypted transactions to ensure the safety of usersâ€™ payment data.
Automated Invoicing: Generate automatic receipts after payments, streamlining financial management for both garage owners and renters.
Impact:
Increases platform reliability and simplifies the process for both users and garage owners.
Provides more payment flexibility, making the platform accessible to a broader range of users.

2. Real-Time Booking Confirmation
Objective:
To ensure no overlap in garage rentals and to improve user satisfaction, introducing real-time booking confirmation will allow users to book garages instantly, preventing any conflicts or double-bookings.
Approach:
Implement real-time database updates (using technologies like Firebase or WebSockets), ensuring that the availability of garages is constantly updated.
As soon as a booking request is made, the system will check availability and confirm the booking within seconds.
Impact:
This will prevent scenarios where multiple users try to book the same garage at the same time, improving trust in the platform.
Enhances user experience by providing instant feedback on bookings, eliminating the uncertainty in waiting for confirmations.

3. Enhanced User Reviews
Objective:
To provide more transparency and improve decision-making for future users, introducing a rating and review system will allow users to share their experiences after renting garages.
Approach:
Implement a 5-star rating system and written reviews where users can share their feedback about the garage and their overall rental experience.
Garage Owners will also be able to reply to reviews, giving them the chance to clarify or respond to concerns.
Impact:
Increases user confidence by allowing them to make informed decisions based on the experiences of others.
Improves accountability for garage owners, encouraging them to maintain high service standards.

4. Mobile App Development
Objective:
While the current platform is built for desktop access, a mobile app will improve accessibility, allowing users to book garages conveniently from their smartphones.
Approach:
Develop native mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms using frameworks like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.
The app will provide all the core functionalities available on the desktop, including search, booking, payment, and notifications.
Impact:
Enhances user accessibility, particularly for users on the go who need quick access to book parking spots.
Opens up new opportunities for features such as location-based notifications and real-time garage availability while driving.

5. Smart Notifications
Objective:
To improve user engagement and satisfaction, smart notifications will alert users about important updates, such as available garages in their preferred locations or reminders for upcoming bookings.
Approach:
Implement push notifications for mobile apps and email or SMS alerts for web users.
Alerts can be triggered based on the user's preferences (e.g., favorite areas or preferred booking times).
Reminders for bookings that are about to expire, helping users extend or cancel their bookings.
Impact:
Improves user engagement by keeping them informed about important events without needing to check the app constantly.
Helps users avoid missed bookings or overbooking, thus enhancing the overall experience.

Summary:
Each of these future developments will greatly improve the functionality and user experience of the Rent Garage platform. Integrating payment systems and real-time booking will simplify user interactions, while enhanced reviews and mobile accessibility will provide more value. Smart notifications will increase user engagement and ensure smoother transactions for renters and garage owners alike. Together, these features will transform the platform into a more comprehensive and scalable solution for urban parking needs.
